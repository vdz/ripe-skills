name: maintaining-ripe-projects
description: Use when starting a session on a Ripe Method project, resuming work from a previous session, dispatching subagents for implementation tasks, or maintaining CLAUDE.md and PROGRESS.md files. Also use when auditing code against Ripe skills or deciding what to save in memory after a session.

# Maintaining Ripe Projects

## Overview

The agentic layer of The Ripe Method — how AI agents build, maintain, and evolve Ripe projects across sessions.

**Core principle:** A new CLI session should be productive within 60 seconds of reading CLAUDE.md + PROGRESS.md. If it can't be, those files are stale.

**Default assumption:** Any user-facing application is a Ripe app. All Ripe skills, acceptance criteria, and audit checklists apply unless CLAUDE.md explicitly states otherwise. Non-UI work (CLI tools, build scripts, backend services) is exempt.

## When to Use

- Starting or resuming a session on a Ripe project
- Dispatching subagents for implementation tasks → see [dispatch-protocol.md](dispatch-protocol.md)
- Auditing code against Ripe skills → see [audit-checklist.md](audit-checklist.md)
- Configuring hooks for quality enforcement → see [hooks-reference.md](hooks-reference.md)

---

## CLAUDE.md Freshness

Every Ripe project has a CLAUDE.md at its root — the single entry point for any agent.

**Mandatory sections:** What This Is, Progress & Documents (including TASK-ARCHIVE.md), Architecture, TSX Return Statement Rules, Import Conventions, Key Files, Skills to Follow, Design System, Build & Dev, Backend Contracts, Testing.

The Skills to Follow section MUST include:
```
- `maintaining-ripe-projects` — task lifecycle, session checklists.
  **ALWAYS follow the Task Completion Flow when marking tasks done.**
```

For the full CLAUDE.md scaffold, see `ripe-init` skill's [claude-md-template.md](../ripe-init/claude-md-template.md).

### Staleness Detection

| Signal | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Key Files tree doesn't match `ls` | Regenerate the tree |
| Test count is wrong | Update after adding tests |
| New skill not listed in "Skills to Follow" | Add it |
| "Progress & Documents" links broken | Fix paths |
| Architecture missing a new pattern | Describe it |
| Build commands changed | Update |
| TASK-ARCHIVE.md linked but file missing | Create empty TASK-ARCHIVE.md with header |

**When to update:** After structural changes (new files, new patterns, build changes). Not after every commit.

---

## PROGRESS.md — Rolling Task Board

A rolling window of **5–7 active tasks**. Completed tasks archive to TASK-ARCHIVE.md.

```markdown
# {Project Name} — Build Progress

**Branch:** `feature/branch-name`  |  **Plan:** `path/to/plan.md`  |  **Started:** YYYY-MM-DD

| # | Task | Status | Commit | Notes |
|---|------|--------|--------|-------|
| 8 | ProgressRail | done | 742e75d | Responsive, a11y |
| 9 | Step Components | in progress | — | 5 of 9 done |
| 10 | ScreeningFlow | pending | — | blocked on T9 |

## Session Log
- **YYYY-MM-DD T8** ProgressRail — 3 breakpoints (742e75d)
```

**Status values:** `pending` | `in progress` | `in review` | `done` | `blocked`

**Rules:** Update after each task (not in batch). Session Log is append-only. Include commit hashes. When table exceeds 7 rows, archive oldest `done` rows and backfill from plan.

## TASK-ARCHIVE.md — Learning Corpus

Project-permanent file at root. Survives branch merges. Referenced from CLAUDE.md.

Each completed task gets:

```markdown
## T{N}: {Task Name}
- **Date:** 2026-03-24
- **Branch:** feature/prod-58108-new-lstv-portal
- **Operator:** {human}
- **Model:** Opus 4.6
- **Agent:** subagent (worktree) | orchestrator | manual
- **Outcome:** success | partial | failure | abandoned
- **Commit:** abc1234
- **Files touched:** 12
- **Tests added:** 19

### Takeaway
{What worked, what didn't, what should change — 1-3 sentences}

### Improvement
{Optional: specific skill update, CLAUDE.md fix, or new hook to propose}
```

---

## Task Completion Flow

**Mandatory and automatic** — every time a task is marked `done`:

```
1. Mark "done" in PROGRESS.md, add commit hash
2. REFLECT — write takeaway. Failures are more valuable than successes.
3. ARCHIVE — write full entry to TASK-ARCHIVE.md
4. TRIM — if PROGRESS.md > 7 rows, remove oldest done rows
5. BACKFILL — pull next pending tasks from plan (stay at 5-7)
6. COMMIT — both PROGRESS.md and TASK-ARCHIVE.md
```

---

## Learning Routing

TASK-ARCHIVE.md is the **single intake** for all learnings. Every takeaway from the Task Completion Flow gets routed through this table:

```
DESTINATION              │ WHEN TO USE                              │ HOW TO EXECUTE
─────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────
Skill update             │ Pattern applies to ALL Ripe projects     │ Invoke `writing-skills` skill (see example below)
CLAUDE.md fix            │ Learning specific to THIS project        │ Edit CLAUDE.md directly
Hook addition            │ Enforcement can be automated             │ Update hooks-reference.md + install via CLI
Feedback memory          │ Cross-project user preference             │ Save to Claude Code memory system
No action                │ One-off, not a pattern                   │ —
```

Feedback memories are a **promotion** from the archive — only learnings that transcend the current project.

### Skill Update Example

When the routing table points to "Skill update", invoke the `writing-skills` skill with:
- **Target file** — which skill file to change
- **What to change** — the specific rule, pattern, or instruction to add/modify
- **Why** — the takeaway that motivated it

Example invocation:
> "In `maintaining-ripe-projects/hooks-reference.md`, add a staleness signal for TASK-ARCHIVE.md referenced in CLAUDE.md but missing from disk. Reason: fresh clones fail silently when the archive file doesn't exist yet."

## Session Lifecycle

### Session Start

```
1. Read CLAUDE.md — architecture, contracts, conventions
2. Dispatch sub-agent to run tests + type-check (non-blocking)
3. Read PROGRESS.md — where we left off (5-7 active tasks)
4. Read the plan — full scope, what's next
5. Review test baseline report from sub-agent
6. Identify next task from PROGRESS.md
```

The test sub-agent runs in parallel while you read context. It reports:
- Pass/fail counts
- Which test files are failing

This is **informational, not a hard blocker** — mid-development tests may be legitimately failing. The orchestrator uses PROGRESS.md context (which tasks are in-progress) to judge whether failures are expected TDD red or regressions.

If the test report shows unexpected failures (not covered by in-progress tasks), investigate before starting new work.

### Mid-Session (After Each Task)

```
1. Run tests + type-check — all clean?
2. Execute Task Completion Flow (mandatory)
3. Did this task change architecture? → Update CLAUDE.md
```

### Session End

```
1. Run full test suite + type-check — confirm clean
2. Verify PROGRESS.md — all statuses current
3. Update CLAUDE.md — if structural changes were made
4. Run Learning Routing scan on TASK-ARCHIVE.md (see Learning Routing section)
5. Commit everything
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Dispatching without field name contract | Add contract table to both task prompts |
| Not updating PROGRESS.md after completion | Update immediately — don't batch |
| CLAUDE.md test count wrong | Update after each test-adding task |
| Subagent uses Sonnet "for speed" | Always Opus. Quality > speed |
| Scope assumed from reference source | Confirm: "You said all — extend to rest?" |
| Skipping Task Completion Flow | Mandatory: reflect → archive → trim → backfill → commit |
| Writing learning directly to memory | All learnings → TASK-ARCHIVE.md. Scan promotes to memory |
| PROGRESS.md grows past 7 rows | Trim oldest done to archive. Backfill from plan |
| Implementer modifies tests to pass | Separate test/impl roles. Implementer can't touch tests |
| Parallel agents edit same file | Check file ownership. Serialize if overlap |
